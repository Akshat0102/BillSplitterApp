## Inspiration
Inspiration from a prior tip calculator app that I made. 
## What the app does
The app splits bill equally among friends. The splitted amount cound be rounded-of using the toggle button. The bill amount can't be null or zero neither does the number of friends. Also we can't have fractional friends (haha) so decimal isn't allowed in number of friends. 
## How I built it
I built it in Android Studio with Kotlin following material guidelines.
## Challenges I ran into
Challenge was developing the UI of the app so that it is user friendly.
